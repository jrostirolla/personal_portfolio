            Hi there! My name is James, and I'm currently looking to grow
            my knowledge and become a programmer! I started out as a surveyor,
            worked 8 years in the field, and finally decided that it wasn't
            what I wanted to do anymore. So I left the industry and join the 
            coding side instead, to see what it's all about!
        </p>
        <p>
            I am driven for success in the industry. With my many years of survey
            knowledge, I hope to work with companies to better improve on the
            modern technology surveyors use everyday. I also hope to one day
            learn enough to become a teacher myself, and prepare the next
            generation of programmers!
        </p>
        <p>
            I have worked in a lot of interesting places in my career. Some of 
            my proudest jobs include the containment upgrades on the Bomaderry Ethanol
            plant, construction surveys conducted across various large 
            housing developments across NSW, and working with various other contractors
            on the contruction of the Parramatta Light Rail.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently working on developing my creative skills through studying
            in the "UNSW Trinity Coding Bootcamp", and hope to find work with a company 
            working with survey technology, as  I believe my experience will be very 
            useful to my work.
