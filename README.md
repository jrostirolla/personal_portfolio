# personal_portfolio
Hello, and welcome to my portfolio!

Inside, you will find a display of my finished projects, as well as a couple works in progress.

Unfortunately, I could not achieve the formatting I wanted, which left me unable to complete all the acceptance criteria, but I finished most of them.
There is also an unknown issue that has occurred with my images not showing up at all on my webpage. I am not sure why this is occuring, nor how to fix it as the local example shows the correct images, and the online version of my file is the same as my offline drive.

The live page can be accessed at the following address: https://jrostirolla.github.io/personal_portfolio/
